// can be invoked - through a callback by the setTimeout function, and immediately in response to a bank email if that email
// results in the number of pending becoming equal to the number of confirmed intents. The former invocation is started on the
// assumption that the bank email hasn't come yet, so it sees 1 pending and 0 confirmed. During execution, the latter invocation
// is started because of a bank email, and this time it sees 1 pending and 1 confirmed because it just incremented confirmed by 1.
// So at the end of the first invocation, the client is notified that there has been no confirmation, and very quickly after that
// the second invocation finishes and notifies the client that there has been a confirmation, and our bug is born.
// One solution is to use another mutex like for our donationIntents. Since the first invocation deletes the redis record for the
// intent, the second invocation would see no ongoing intents and issue an unknown donation source notification.
